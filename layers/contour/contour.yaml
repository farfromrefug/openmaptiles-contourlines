        The index field can be used to emphasize index contours, but it can also be used to reduce the contour density if you wish. The highest value that applies to a contour will be the index value, so if you want to highlight every fifth line, you need to select both index=5 and index=10. If you want to highlight every other line, you need to select both index=2 and index=10 (or both index=1 and index=5).
